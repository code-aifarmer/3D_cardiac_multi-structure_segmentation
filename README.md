# Segmentation of multiple structures in 3D cardiac CTA images
### This project aims to develop a high-precision multi-structure segmentation system for cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) images that can automatically identify and segment key cardiac structures such as the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricular myocardium. The project uses rotation and CT window techniques for data enhancement and preprocessing, a 3D-Unet deep learning architecture enhanced by convolutional block attention modules (CBAM), and high-performance computing resources at the University of Leeds ARC4 for model training and optimization, which successfully improves the accuracy and generalization of the model.
